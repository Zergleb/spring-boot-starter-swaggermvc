# spring-boot-starter-swaggermvc

In the beginning stages this project automatically creates a swagger ui page at /swagger for all of the endpoints on the system.

This is using swaggermvc but I think I need to rewrite my own swagger mvc integration because this takes 60 seconds to start on a small application with few endpoints.
